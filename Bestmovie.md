best movie

This summer i watched indiana jones raiders of the lost ark. Indiana jones must go an adventure to find a artifact and along his journey he fights nazi's and other villians. This was probably the best movie I watched because of the nostalgic feeling from watching it when i was younger. The best scene is at the start of the movie when Jones takes the artifacts but then the boulder chases him out through a narrow tunnel. Although this movie is a bit cheesy its still  a fun watch This was the best movie I watched this summer.

This movie is one of the best of all time
